# IMDB-Analysis

The IMDB analysis was a courseproject of Machine learning with my team. In this project, we used the library to compare the training results of different algorithms with the same training datas.  
First, we established the training data set and test data set, which was to convert the reviews to a table. The table was to record the numbers of different words in one review for each review. And to improve the efficiency, we also remove stopwords.
Second, we used different models to analyze the data, such as Logistic Regression, Multiple Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and SVM. 
Finally, we  found the result of Multiple Naive Bayes was the best.
